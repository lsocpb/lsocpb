## 🚀 Few things about me

🤯 My name is Łukasz, I'm currently studying "Computer Sciene and Econometrics" and will graduate in mid-2024.

🌐 I'm in love with traveling around the world. I usually travel around Europe (Belgium, Germany, Montenegro), but i also visited one country in Asia (Cyprus).

📚 In free time i like reading self-development books like 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' by Kiyosaki, 'How to think and grow rich' by Hill, 
'How to get friends and influence others' by Carnegie.
