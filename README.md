## 🚀 Few things about me

🤯 My name is Łukasz, I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering in CS and Econometrics. Currently involved in my Masters Degree in Computer Science.

🌐 I'm in love with traveling around the world. I usually travel around Europe (Belgium, Germany, Montenegro, Greece), but I also have visited one country in Asia (Cyprus).

📚 In my free time I like reading self-development books like 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' by Kiyosaki, 'How to think and grow rich' by Hill, 
'How to get friends and influence others' by Carnegie.
